# VSharpBSP
Q3 BSP parser and scene builder for Unity 3D

* Parse BSP3 files
* Basic working doors
* Basic working jump-pad
* Debug views for entities placed in map
* Collision using Unity's mesh face collisions
* Basic Q3 like Character controller
* Placeholder entities classes

### INCOMPLETE
* I tried to get original brushes to be built using some convex hull algorithms, but was not successful. 
* There may be issues in how I'm interpreting the brushes planes data. 

### TODO
* Reverse-engineer entities, or build your own custom ones
* Parse & import MDL models
